# **Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction**

This repository contains machine learning models for predicting the presence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on various health parameters. It demonstrates the use of Decision Trees and Random Forests for this purpose.

# **Description**

The project first loads a dataset related to Chronic Kidney Disease and preprocesses the data by handling missing values and normalizing the data. Then, it applies Decision Tree and Random Forest models to predict whether a person has the disease or not. The performance of each model is displayed in terms of accuracy, confusion matrix, sensitivity, and specificity.

The models are built and evaluated multiple times with different random seeds for shuffling the data to ensure the robustness of the results.
